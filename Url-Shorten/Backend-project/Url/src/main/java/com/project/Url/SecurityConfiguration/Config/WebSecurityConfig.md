No worries! Let me break it down **step by step** in simple terms.

---

### **1️⃣ `@Configuration` - Why is it needed?**
- Think of this annotation like **a blueprint for security settings**.
- It tells Spring Boot: **"This class contains important security configurations."**
- Without it, Spring won't recognize the security rules you define inside.

📌 **Example**
```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    // Spring knows this class has important settings
}
```

---

### **2️⃣ `@EnableWebSecurity` - Why is it needed?**
- Enables **Spring Security** in the application.
- Without this, your app **won't have any security features** (like login, authentication, etc.).
- **Required to make security settings work.**

📌 **Example**
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
    // Security settings go here
}
```

---

### **3️⃣ `@EnableMethodSecurity` - Why is it needed?**
- This lets you **secure individual methods** using `@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured`.
- Without this, your app **cannot protect methods** like:
  ```java
  @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
  public void deleteUser() { ... }
  ```
- With `@EnableMethodSecurity`, this method will **only allow ADMIN users** to access it.

📌 **Example**
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
    // Enables method-level security
}
```

---

### **4️⃣ `@AllArgsConstructor` - Why is it needed?**
- It's a **shortcut** for writing a constructor that takes all fields as parameters.
- Instead of manually writing a constructor, this **automatically creates one for you**.
- **Prevents needing `@Autowired` on fields.**

📌 **Example without `@AllArgsConstructor` (Manual Constructor)**
```java
public class UserService {
    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public UserService(PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
        this.passwordEncoder = passwordEncoder;
    }
}
```

📌 **Example with `@AllArgsConstructor` (Lombok Magic 🚀)**
```java
@AllArgsConstructor
public class UserService {
    private final PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; // No need for @Autowired
}
```
💡 **Why is this better?**
- **More efficient** than `@Autowired`.
- **Easier to test & debug.**
- **Removes unnecessary field injections.**

### **🔥 FINAL SUMMARY**
| Annotation | What It Does | Why You Need It |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `@Configuration` | Marks the class as a configuration file | So Spring recognizes it as a settings file |
| `@EnableWebSecurity` | Enables Spring Security | Without this, security won't work |
| `@EnableMethodSecurity` | Allows method-level security | To use `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured` |
| `@AllArgsConstructor` | Generates constructor for all fields | Removes need for `@Autowired` |

### **🔧 FIX YOUR CODE**
🔴 **Before (Bad Practice)**
```java
@Autowired
private UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsService;
```
✅ **After (Good Practice)**
```java
private final UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsService; // No need for @Autowired
```

💡 **Now Spring will automatically inject it via the constructor!** 🚀
